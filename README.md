# Goroutine Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of practice codes and examples for understanding and working with Goroutines in Go. Goroutines are lightweight threads that allow concurrent execution of functions or methods. This repository serves as a resource for learning and exploring Goroutines and their applications.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- **Examples**: A directory containing various code examples that demonstrate different aspects of Goroutines, such as creation, synchronization, communication, and error handling.
- **Utilities**: Utility functions or packages that can be useful when working with Goroutines.
- **Exercises**: A set of exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of Goroutines. These exercises range from basic to advanced concepts and cover a wide range of use cases.
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to this repository, should you choose to do so.

## Getting Started

To get started with Goroutines, you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fadhlidev/golang-goroutine.git
```


## Running the Examples

All the examples here are written as test files. To run the examples, navigate to the relevant directory and execute the Go files using the `go test` command. For instance, if you want to run an example named `example.go`, use the following command:
```bash
go test example.go
```

Feel free to explore the examples, modify the code, and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding of Goroutines.
